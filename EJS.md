####Problem 1 ####
```
Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

####My Solution ####

```
var count = '';
while(count < '#######'){
	count += '#';
	console.log(count);
}
```


####Problem 2####

```
FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
```

####My Solution####

```
for(var i = 0; i <= 100; i++){
  if(i % 15 === 0){
  	console.log("fizzbuzz");
  } else if(i % 3 === 0){
  	console.log('fizz');
  } else if(i % 5 === 0){
  	console.log('buzz');
  } else(console.log(i));
}
